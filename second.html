<p>Diversity is valuable to both associates and businesses. Although associates are
equally reliant on in the workplace, respecting individual changes can raise
production. Diversity in the workplace can decrease grievances and raise
marketing, chances, employment, creativeness, and professional images. In years
when flexibility and creativeness are resolutions to effectiveness, diversity is
acute for an establishments achievement. Also, the concerns (loss of time and
currency) should not be overlooked.</p>

  levels of diversity in the firm increases, our definition implies that the benefits fall for each additional minority employee hired, until it reaches zero
  when the firm achieves a workforce, which is representative of the population. Internal business benefits: The suggestion is that increased diversity improves
  problem solving and other outcomes, independent of the levels of diversity in wider society. If increased diversity, of itself, is desirable then there can
  continue to be benefits even after a firm has achieved a representative workforce.</p>

  (and society) should place a greater value on the promotion of individuals from groups that suffer disadvantage. In our simple economic framework, the two

  which best reflect the society they serve, there are no additional benefits of hiring minority over majority group workers for firms that have achieved a
  representative workforce.</p></i>
