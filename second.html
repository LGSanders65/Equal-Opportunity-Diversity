  <img align="left">Diversity is valuable to both associates and businesses. Although associates are equally reliant on in the workplace, respecting individual changes can raise production. Diversity in the workplace can decrease grievances and raise marketing, chances, employment, creativeness, and professional images. In years when flexibility and creativeness are resolutions to effectiveness, diversity is acute for an establishmentâ€™s achievement. Also, the concerns (loss of time and currency) should not be overlooked.  Establish a sense of belonging for everyone, Empathetic leadership is key, A top-down approach isn't enough, Maximize joy and connection, not fear. Diversity refers to the traits and characteristics that make people unique while inclusion refers to the behaviors and social norms that ensure people feel welcome.<br>

If increased diversity, of itself, is desirable then there can
  continue to be benefits even after a firm has achieved a representative workforce.</p>
